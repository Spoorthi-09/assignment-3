    <h1><u>SUNSET</u></h1>
    <p>Sunset, also known as sundown, is the daily disappearance of the Sun below the horizon due to Earth's rotation. As viewed from the Equator, the equinox Sun sets exactly due west in both Spring and Autumn.</p>
    <p>The time of sunset is defined in astronomy as the moment when the upper limb of the Sun disappears below the horizon. Near the horizon, atmospheric refraction causes sunlight rays to be distorted to such an extent that geometrically the solar disk is already about one diameter below the horizon when a sunset is observed.</p>

      <p><li><u><b>ULUWANTU TEMPLE,BALI</b></u></li><br>
      <p>Temples are a common sighting in Bali, but Uluwatu Temple, which perches on a cliff 250 meters above the crashing waves of the Indian Ocean, is unique. It’s open all day but many flock to the area in the late afternoon to secure a viewing spot on the edge of the cliff for optimal selfie taking and sunset gazing.</p>

      <p><li><u><b>ISLE OF EIGG,SCOTLAND</b></u></li><br>
      <p>Here, a dramatic, orange-hued sunset plays striking contrast to the looming craggy peaks of Askival, Ainshval, Hallival, Trollival and Barkeval. Many choose to make the trip from Fort William .</p>

      <p><li><u><b>OIA,GREECE</b></u></li><br>
      <p>This traditional whitewashed village is a highlight of Greek island Santorini. Travellers tread the cobbled streets in droves to reserve top viewing spots and there are plenty of bars, cafes and restaurants that promise dining with a view. The sunset is picture perfect: with blush pink tinges sweeping across the sky; reflecting off the stunning white buildings that teeter at the top of the cliff. </p>

      <p><li><u><b>ANKOR TEMPLES COMBODIA</b></u></li><br>
      <p>The most famous of all temples is Angkor Wat, which can be found on the Cambodian flag and is thought to be one of the largest religious buildings in the world. To catch the stunning sunset at this incredible location, many now head specifically to Pre Rup (aka pyramid tower) when sunset dawns. It’s the ideal spot to take in a burnt orange sunset that eclipses the sky; illuminating the surrounding tower of brick and laterite.</p>

      <p><li><u><b>SUGARLOAF ROCK,AUSTRALIA</b></u></li><br>
      <p>This stunning granite rock formation is just over a mile from Cape Naturaliste; a coastal landform in Western Australia. Admittedly it is beautiful by day, but it becomes a thing of wonder in the evenings. The viewing platform located directly opposite Sugarloaf Rock allows you take in the landform in all its glory as the sun sets over the Indian Ocean behind it. </p>
